# Sample Profile Image

This is a placeholder for your profile image. 

To add your actual profile photo:

1. Add your profile image file to the `public` folder
2. Name it `profile.jpg` (or update the filename in the code)
3. Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp

The image will be automatically optimized by Next.js for better performance.

If no image is found, it will fallback to showing the developer emoji.
